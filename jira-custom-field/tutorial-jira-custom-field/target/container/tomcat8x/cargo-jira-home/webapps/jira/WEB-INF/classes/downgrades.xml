<!--
Details of all the downgrade tasks for JIRA.

A downgrade task is an explicit reversal of an upgrade task.
The "build number" for a downgrade task is the number of the upgrade task it reverses.
eg downgrade task 117 would reverse upgrade task 117 and move the current build number to 116.

Not all upgrade tasks have explicit downgrade tasks - most often the reversal is a NO-OP.
The UpgradeHistory DB table stores a history of all upgrades that have run along with a flag of whether the reversal
is a no-op or if it requires a downgrade task.

See also the "upgrades.xml" file.
